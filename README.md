# Around React

## Github Pages: https://AlecDrosu.github.io/around-react

This is the first sprint out of 2 to turn the web-project-4 repo into a react-app. It is my first project using react, and let me say that ***I LOVE REACT***. There were times with base JS that I wanted to rip my hair out but react was the answer. I intend to continue using react for all my future projects.
